Allocating a char array and accessing it properly within the Instruction RAM (IRAM) of ESP32.

This example follows the requirement of:

`The CPU can access data via the data bus in a byte-, half-word-, or word-aligned manner. The CPU can also access data via the instruction bus, but only in a word-aligned manner; non-word-aligned access will cause a CPU exception`
